"THE NERD-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 1):
[<$Committer.email>] wrote this file. As long as you retain this notice you
can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me/us a beer, mate or some food in return

1. Intentions

The NERD-WARE LICENSE was created by and for Students, Programmers, Hackers, Nerds, Geeks and alike to be able to license their work under a free license (free REALLY as in free bear). Instead of restricting the distribution and use of any creative work, it allowes anyone to do what they want with the work but gives the useres a hint, to somehow aknowledge the work and support the creator(s) by small means, as in buying them a beer, Mate or some Food to let him or her know, that his work was appreciated.

2. Origins

The NERD-WARE LICENSE is an adaption of the BEERWARE-LICENSE to include Mate and some Food along with beer as a mean to support the creator(s). This was mostly done, as we are poor students that need food and are addicted to Mmte.

2. Usecase

The NERD-WARE LICENSE is, due to its nature (and name), designed for Students, Geeks, Hackers, Nerds and the like to license their code, their notes and the like. But if you like beer, mate and/or food, feel free to use it anyways.
