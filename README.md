# THE NERDWARE LICENSE

THE NERDWARE License is a License is an adaption of the [Beerware License]().
As Beer at some point decreases productivity we decided to also include
Mate [like this][] and food to instead increase our productivity.

[like this]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate


## Excuse Me?

You got it right. Just use the Software licensed with THE NERDWARE
LICENSE in every way you like, change it, tear it apart, put it back
together, as long as you keep the Legal Notice. 

THE NERDWARE LICENSE was created by and for Students, Programmers,
Hackers, Nerds, Geeks and alike to be able to license their work under
a free license (free REALLY as in free bear). Instead of restricting the
distribution and use of any creative work, it allows anyone to do what
they want with the work but gives the user a hint, to somehow
acknowledge the work and support the creator(s) by small means, as in
buying them a beer, Mate or some Food to let him or her know, that his
work was appreciated.

you can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and

food in return [Phillip Thelen, Franz Greiling]
